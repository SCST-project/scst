				<h1>ISCSI target driver iSCSI-SCST</h1>
				<p><strong>ISCSI-SCST</strong> is a forked (with all respects) version of <strong>IET</strong> with updates to work 
				over <strong>SCST</strong> as well as with many improvements and bugfixes. The reason of fork is that the necessary 
				changes are intrusive and with the current <strong>IET</strong> merge policy, where only simple bugfix-like patches,
				 which doesn't touch the core code, could be merged, it is very unlikely that they will be merged in the main 
				 <strong>IET</strong> trunk.</p>
				
				<p><strong>ISCSI-SCST</strong> has the following major advantages over the mainline <strong>IET</strong>:
				<ul>
					<li><span>It uses full power of <strong>SCST core</strong> without loosing any existing feature (except, maybe, illegal
					 from SCSI specifications point of view MPIO). Namely, you can additionally use with it:
					 <ul>
						<li><span><strong>Pass-through mode with one to many relationship</strong>, i.e. when multiple initiators can connect to the 
						exported pass-through devices. For instance, you can safely export your parallel
						<strong>SCSI tape</strong> or <strong>tape library</strong> on 
						your iSCSI net and multiple initiators can share it without risk of data loss because of the 
						shared usage. Existing "rawio" patch for IET supports only non-enforced 1:1 
						relationship, so it is unsafe to use it in multiple initiators environments.</span></li>
						<li><span><strong>More advances devices visibility management</strong>, when different initiators can see different set of 
						devices with different access permissions from the same target.</span></li>
						<li><span><strong>O_DIRECT</strong>, i.e. "<strong>BLOCKIO</strong> on files", mode, which has all advantages 
						of <strong>BLOCKIO</strong>, but also supports files on file systems. Sometimes, in the appropriate cases, 
						this mode can make performance difference in 100% or even more.</span></li>
						<li><span>With <strong>4KB blocks</strong> you can forget about abysmal write performance caused by misaligned partitions. 
						All modern OS'es, including Windows starting from, at least, Windows 2000, work perfectly with 4KB block 
						devices without any additional storage or handling overhead.</span></li>
						<li><span><strong>Virtual CD/DVD-ROMs</strong> without necessity for manual patching.</span></li>	
						<li><span>Ability to create target devices emulators in the <strong>user space</strong>.</span></li>
						<li><span>Ability to create <strong>multi-transport SCSI targets</strong>, which can export (possibly, the same) 
						devices over multiple transports.</span></li>																 
					 </ul>					 
					 </span></li>
					 <li><span>It has many code improvements and cleanups, including <strong>stability and iSCSI RFC violations fixes</strong>. 
					  Many IET users use it for ages without problems, so they consider it problemless. But,
					  in fact, unfortunately, it isn't so.
					  IET works well only on "fast" paths and regularly used branches, in many other less used
					  cases IET has various problems, from simply ignoring error processing, as it is with memory 
					  allocations, and crashing itself with BUG() macro, as it is for malformed packets from initiators, to possible data
					  corruption. See, for instance, <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/thread/53797?tstart=0&start=15">this</a>
					  thread on a VMware forum about in which <strong>Russian roulette</strong> IET users play using it with VMware.
					  ChangeLog file lists most noticeable fixes, but there were a lot of many other smaller ones.</span></li>
					 <li><span>Due to reworked I/O architecture and <strong>SCST</strong> backend <strong>iSCSI-SCST</strong> has
					  better performance in many cases. In future with upcoming improvements in <strong>SCST core</strong>, like zero-copy 
					  with Linux cache <strong>FILEIO</strong>, the performance difference is going to be even bigger. Currently in 
					  tests from a single initiator over a single connection on 1GbE hardware over <strong>FILEIO</strong> vdisk 
					  <strong>iSCSI-SCST</strong> with default settings usually outperforms tuned for best
					  performance <strong>IET</strong> a on <strong>3-30%</strong>. The difference is especially noticeably with real storage,
					  not NULLIO or RAM disks.
					  On 10GbE hardware the performance difference is often as high as <strong>100-200%</strong> or even more.
					  With higher number of initiators the difference will be even bigger. This is because 
					  <strong>iSCSI-SCST</strong> has less commands processing overhead per command, hence has smaller processing 
					  latency and puts less load on CPU.			
				</ul></p>
				<p>Also, in contrast to <strong>IET, iSCSI-SCST</strong> is open for any new development, modifications and 
				improvements, so people who want to fix or implement something new will not have to keep and maintain separate 
				patches as it is currently necessary with <strong>IET</strong>. <strong>ISCSI-SCST</strong> is actively
				 developed and going to gain in the future new features like support for multiple connections per session, error recovery 
				 levels >0, etc., which eventually make it really <i>"Enterprise"</i>.</p>
				
				<p>If you are an IET user before installation carefully read README files of both iSCSI-SCST and 
				the SCST core. Especially pay attention that now the LUN information for iSCSI-SCST is configured not using 
				iscsi-scstd.conf file in /etc, but using corresponding SCST facilities. This is because now the responsibilities 
				are divided (as it should be) between the target driver (iSCSI-SCST) and the SCST core: target driver is 
				responsible for handling targets and their parameters, SCST core is responsible for handling backstorage.</p>

				<p>The latest stable version is 1.0.0. Requires Linux kernel version 2.6.16.x or higher and SCST version 1.0.0 or higher. 
				Tested mostly on i386 and x86_64, but should work on any other supported by Linux platform.</p>
				<p>You can find the latest development version of this driver in the SCST SVN. See the download page how to setup 
				access to it.</p>
