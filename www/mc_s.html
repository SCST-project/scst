<h1>MC/S vs MPIO</h1>

<p>MC/S (Multiple Connections per Session) is a feature of iSCSI
protocol, which allows to combine several connections inside a single
session for performance and failover purposes. Let's consider what
practical value this feature has comparing with OS level multipath
(MPIO) and try to answer why none of Open Source OS'es neither still
support it, despite of many years since iSCSI protocol started
being actively used, nor going to implement it in the future.</p>

<p>MC/S is done on the iSCSI level, while MPIO is done on the higher
level. Hence, all MPIO infrastructure is shared among all SCSI
transports, including Fibre Channel, SAS, etc. </p>

<p>MC/S was designed at time, when most OS'es didn't have standard OS level
multipath. Instead, each vendor had its own implementation, which
created huge interoperability problems. So, one of the goals of MC/S was
to address this issue and standardize the multipath area in a single standard. But
nowadays almost all OS'es has OS level multipath implemented using
standard SCSI facilities, hence this purpose of MC/S isn't valid anymore.</p>

<p>Usually it is claimed, than MC/S has the following 2 advantages over MPIO:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Faster failover recovery.</span></li>

	<li><span>Better performance.</span></li>

</ol>

<p>Let's look how realistic those claims are.</p>

<h2>Failover recovery time</h2>

<p>Let's consider a single target exporting a single device over 2 links.</p>

<p>For MC/S failover recovery is quite simple: all outstanding SCSI
commands reassigned to another connection. No other actions are
necessary, because session (i.e. I_T Nexus) remains the same.
Consequently, all reservations and other SCSI states as well as other
initiators connected to the device remain unaffected.</p>

<p>For MPIO failover recovery is much more complicated. This is because
it involves transfer of all outstanding commands and SCSI states from one
I_T Nexus to another. The first thing, which initiator will do for
that is to abort all outstanding commands on the faulted
I_T Nexus. There are 2 approaches for that: CLEAR TASK SET and LUN RESET
task management functions. </p>

<p>CLEAR TASK SET function aborts all commands on the device.
Unfortunately, it has limitations: it isn't always supported by device
and having single task set shared over initiators isn't always
appropriate for application.</p>

<p>LUN RESET function resets the device.</p>

<p>Both CLEAR TASK SET and LUN RESET functions can somehow harm
other initiators, because all commands from all initiators, not only 
from one doing the failover recovery, will be aborted. Additionally, LUN
RESET resets all SCSI settings for all connected initiators to the
initial state and, if device had reservation from any initiator, it will
be cleared.

<p>But the harm is minimal:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span> With TAS bit set on Control Mode page, all the aborted commands will
	be returned to all affected initiators with TASK ABORTED status, so they
	can simply immediately retry them. For CLEAR TASK SET if TAS isn't set
	all affected initiators will be notified by Unit Attention COMMANDS
	CLEARED BY ANOTHER INITIATOR, so they also can immediately retry all
	outstanding commands.</span></li>

	<li><span>In case of the device reset the affected initiators will be notified via
	the corresponding Unit Attention about reset of
	all SCSI settings to the initial state. Then the initiators can do necessary
	recovery actions. Usually no recovery actions are needed, except for the
	reservation holder, whose reservation was cleared. For it recovery might
	be not trivial. But Persistent Reservations solve this issue, because
	they are not cleared by the device reset.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, with Persistent Reservations or using  CLEAR TASK SET function
additional failover recovery time, which MPIO has comparing to MC/S,
is time to wait for reset or commands abort finished and time to
retry all the aborted commands. On a properly configured system it
should be less than few seconds, which is well acceptable on practice.
If Linux storage stack improved to allow to abort all submitted to it
commands (currently only wait for their completion is possible), then
time to abort all the commands can be decreased to a fraction of second. </p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>At first, neither MC/S, nor MPIO can improve performance if there is
only one SCSI command sent to target at time. For instance, in case of
tape backup and restore. Both MC/S and MPIO work on the commands level,
so can't split data transfers for a single command over several links.
Only bonding (also known as NIC teaming or Link Aggregation) can improve
performance in this case, because it works on the link level.</p>

<p>MC/S over several links preserves commands execution order, i.e. with
it commands executed in the same order as they were submitted. MPIO
can't preserve this order, because it can't see, which command on which
link was submitted earlier. Delays in links processing can change
commands order in the place where target receives them.</p>

<p>Since initiators usually send commands in the optimal for performance
order, reordering can somehow hurt performance. But this can happen only with
naive target implementation, which can't recover the optimal commands execution
order. Currently Linux is not naive and quite good on this area. See, for
instance, section "SEQUENTIAL ACCESS OVER MPIO" in <a
href="vl_res.txt">those measurements</a>. Don't look at the absolute
numbers, look at %% of performance improvement using the second link.
The result equivalent to 200 MB/s over 2 1Gbps links, which is close to
possible maximum.</p>

<p>If free commands reorder is forbidden for a device, either
by use of ORDERED tag, or if the Queue Algorithm Modifier in the Control
Mode Page is set to 0, then MPIO will have to maintain commands order by
sending commands over only a single link. But on practice this case is
really rare and 99.(9)% of OS'es and applications allow free commands
reorder and it is enabled by default.</p>

<p>From other side, strictly preserving commands order as MC/S does has a
downside as well. It can lead to so called "commands ordering
bottleneck", when newer commands have to wait before one or more older
commands get executed, although it would be better for performance to
reorder them. As result, MPIO sometimes has better performance, than
MC/S, especially in setups, where maximum IOPS number is important. See,
for instance,
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.scsi/16311">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>When MC/S is better than MPIO</h2>

<p>For sake of completeness, we should mention that there are marginal cases, where MPIO can't be used or will not
provide any benefit, but MC/S can be successful:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span>When strict commands order is required.</span></li>

	<li><span>When aborted commands can't be retried.</span></li>

</ol>

<p>For disks both of them are always false. However for some tape drives
and backup applications one or both can be true. But on practice:</p>

<ul>

	<li><span>There are neither known tape drives, nor backup
	applications, which can use multiple outstanding commands at
	time. All them support and use only one single outstanding
	command at time. MC/S can't increase performance for them, only
	bonding can. So, in this case there no difference between MC/S
	and MPIO.</span></li>

	<li><span>The lack of ability to retry commands is rather a
	limitation of legacy tape drives, which support only implicit
	address commands, not of MPIO. Modern tape drives and backup
	applications can use explicit address commands, which you can
	abort and then retry, hence they are compatible with MPIO.</span></li>

</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thus:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Cost to develop MC/S is high, but benefits of it are marginal and with future MPIO
	improvements can be fully eliminated.</span></li>

	<li><span>MPIO allows to utilize existing infrastructure for all
	transports, not only iSCSI.
	 </span></li>
	
	<li><span>All transports can benefit from improvements in MPIO.</span></li>

	<li><span>With MPIO there is no need to create multiple layers doing very similar
	functionality.</span></li>

	<li><span> MPIO doesn't have commands ordering bottleneck, which MC/S has. </span></li>

</ol>

<p>Simply, MC/S is rather a workaround done on the wrong level for some deficiencies of existing SCSI standards used for MPIO,
namely the lack of possibility to group several I_T Nexuses with ability to reassign commands
between them and preserve commands order among them. If in future those features added in the SCSI standards, MC/S will
not be needed at all, hence, all investments in it will be voided. No surprise then that no
Open Source OS'es neither support, nor going to implement it. Moreover,
when back to 2005 there was an attempt to add MC/S capable iSCSI initiator in Linux, it was
rejected. See for more details <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.scsi/15769">here</a>
and <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.scsi/16301">here</a>.
