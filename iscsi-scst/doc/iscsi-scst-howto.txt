Installing and using iSCSI-SCST with scstadmin
----------------------------------------------

1. Download, build and install iSCSI-SCST.

Start with downloading the iSCSI-SCST source code. You can either download the
released version from the following URL:

  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=110471

or you can download the latest development version by running the following
command in a shell:

  svn co https://scst.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scst/trunk scst

While iSCSI-SCST works fine with an unpatched Linux kernel with the same
or better speed as other open source iSCSI targets, including IET, if
you want even better performance you have to patch and rebuild the
kernel. Select the patch according to your kernel version (2.6.18.1 in
the example below):

  cd /usr/src/kernels/linux-2.6.18.1
  patch -p1 < $HOME/scst/iscsi-scst/kernel/patches/put_page_callback-2.6.18.1.patch
  patch -p1 < $HOME/scst/scst/kernel/scst_exec_req_fifo-2.6.18.patch
  make clean

Next, build and install the kernel:

  make && make modules
  make modules_install && make install

For some Linux distributions (a.o. Ubuntu and openSUSE) the above steps do not
rebuild the initial RAM disk. Make sure you regenerate the RAM disk before
rebooting. Please look up the documentation of the update-initrd,
update-initramfs or the mkinitrd command supplied with your distribution.

Now reboot the system.

Once the system is again up and running the next step is to build and install
SCST, iSCSI-SCST and scstadmin. You can do this by running the following
command from the SCST directory:

  make scst scst_install iscsi iscsi_install scstadm scstadm_install

iSCSI-SCST includes the following components:
   * /etc/init.d/iscsi-scst - service script
   * iscsi-scstd - daemon
   * man pages
   * Configuration files (located under iscsi-scst/etc/, need to be copied to
     /etc if you want to use them):
      * initiators.allow - used for assigning specific initiators to targets
      * initiators.deny - used for assigning specific initiators to targets
      * iscsi-scstd.conf - list of targets and their properties

2. Set up /etc/iscsi/ininitiatorname.iscsi

The most convenient way to set up this file is to install the open-iscsi
package provided by your Linux distro first and then to run the shell commands
shown below. Verify the contents of the generated file.

  /etc/init.d/open-iscsi stop
  { echo "InitiatorName=$(/usr/sbin/iscsi-iname)"; echo "InitiatorAlias=$(hostname)"; } >/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi
  /etc/init.d/open-iscsi start
  cat /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi

3. Set up /etc/iscsi-scstd.conf

You can do this by e.g. running the following shell commands:

  echo "Target $(sed -n 's/InitiatorName=//p' /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi):storage" >/etc/iscsi-scstd.conf
  cat /etc/iscsi-scstd.conf

4. Set up /etc/scst.conf

The scst.conf configuration file is loaded at system boot time by the shell
script /etc/init.d/scst. All devices known by SCST are defined in this file.
The shell statements shown below set up a configuration file for two vdisks.
Replace the device names by names that apply to your system:

  scstadmin -ClearConfig /etc/scst.conf
  scstadmin -adddev disk01 -path /dev/ram0 -handler vdisk -options NV_CACHE
  scstadmin -adddev disk02 -path /dev/ram1 -handler vdisk -options NV_CACHE
  scstadmin -WriteConfig /etc/scst.conf
  cat /etc/scst.conf

Note that for each SCSI device LUN 0 must exist. This is required by the SCSI
protocol and is also documented in SCST's README file.

5. Edit /etc/init.d/scst

Remove the modules you do not need from the SCST_MODULES variable,
e.g. qla2x00tgt.

6. Create soft links in /etc/init.d

This will make SCST to start automatically upon system boot. Use either
chkconfig or update-rc.d, depending on the Linux distribution you are using.
An example for Debian systems such as Ubuntu:

  update-rc.d scst defaults
  update-rc.d iscsi-scst defaults

On openSUSE you can let SCST start automatically through the following commands:

  insserv scst
  insserv iscsi-scst

7. Restart SCST and iSCSI-SCST

If you don't want to reboot now, you can make the above settings effective via
the following commands:

  /etc/init.d/iscsi-scst stop
  /etc/init.d/scst stop
  /etc/init.d/scst start
  /etc/init.d/iscsi-scst start


Installing and using iSCSI-SCST without using scstadmin
-------------------------------------------------------

First repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 from the previous section but leave out
"scstadm scstadm_install" from the make command in step 1.

Next load the scst_disk kernel module as follows:

  modprobe scst_disk

The shell script /etc/init.d/iscsi-scst can now be used to start/stop/restart or
check the status of iSCSI-SCST.


Selecting devices to be used by SCST
------------------------------------

You can see the list of available devices:

# cat /proc/scsi_tgt/scsi_tgt

LUN masking
-----------

SCST defines security groups. For each group, you can add LUNs. 

If you want to have all LUNs available for all targets, just add them to
the "Default" group:

# echo "add 5:0:0:8 0" >/proc/scsi_tgt/groups/Default/devices
# cat /proc/scsi_tgt/groups/Default/devices
Device (host:ch:id:lun or name)                             Virtual lun  Options
5:0:0:8                                                        0

Now, the LUN "5:0:0:8" was added to the "Default" group as LUN #0.

Note, that you must have LUN 0. That's a SCSI requirement (documented in SCST's README).


Defining LUN masking
--------------------

In order to associate specific LUNs with specific targets, do the following:

   * Create a group for the target:

echo "add_group Default_iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1" >/proc/scsi_tgt/scsi_tgt

   * Add LUNs to the group:

echo "add 4:0:0:8 0" > /proc/scsi_tgt/groups/Default_iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/devices

This will assign the LUN "4:0:0:8" to the target iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1.
Again, you must have LUN 0 for each group.


Deleting a LUN from a group
---------------------------

Run the following command:

echo "del 4:0:0:8 0" > /proc/scsi_tgt/groups/Default_iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/devices

This will remove the LUN "4:0:0:8" from the target iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1.


Deleting a group
----------------

Run the following command:

echo "del_group Default_iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1" >/proc/scsi_tgt/scsi_tgt

For more information about LUN masking, refer to SCST README, section
"Access and devices visibility management (LUN masking)".


Creating targets using iscsi-scstd.conf
---------------------------------------

The easiest way to create targets is to define them in
/etc/iscsi-scstd.conf. An example can be found in etc/iscsi-scstd.conf.
You need to have this file under /etc/ before starting iSCSI-SCST.


Assigning targets to specific initiators
----------------------------------------

In order to assign targets to specific initiators, you need to have
/etc/initiators.allow  and /etc/initiators.deny. You can find
example files in etc/initiators.allow and etc/initiators.deny.

Note that all targets are allowed to all initiators by default, so if
you want to use /etc/initiators.allow, you will need to have
/etc/initiators.deny that looks like this:

ALL ALL

This will deny all initiators expect for those defined in /etc/initiators.allow.

Useful examples of iscsi-scst-adm:

Show a specific target:

# iscsi-scst-adm --op show --tid=1
QueuedCommands=0

Show the configured parameters for a specific target:

# iscsi-scst-adm --op show --tid=1 --sid=0
InitialR2T=No

MaxConnections=0
MaxRecvDataSegmentLength=4269849632
MaxXmitDataSegmentLength=10933
