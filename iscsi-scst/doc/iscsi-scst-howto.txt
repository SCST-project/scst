Installing and using iSCSI-SCST with scstadmin
==============================================

1. Download, build and install iSCSI-SCST.

Start with downloading the iSCSI-SCST source code. You can either download the
released version from the following URL:

  http://scst.sourceforge.net/downloads.html

or you can download the latest development version by running the following
command in a shell:

  svn co https://scst.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scst/trunk scst

While iSCSI-SCST works fine with an unpatched Linux kernel with the same
or better speed as other open source iSCSI targets, including IET, if
you want even better performance you have to patch and rebuild the
kernel. Select the patch according to your kernel version (2.6.38.x in
the example below):

  cd /usr/src/kernels/linux-2.6.38.8
  patch -p1 < $HOME/scst/iscsi-scst/kernel/patches/put_page_callback-2.6.38.patch
  patch -p1 < $HOME/scst/scst/kernel/scst_exec_req_fifo-2.6.38.patch
  make clean

Next, build and install the kernel:

  make && make modules
  make modules_install && make install

For some Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) the above steps do not rebuild the
initial RAM disk. Make sure you regenerate the RAM disk before rebooting.
Please look up the documentation of the update-initrd, update-initramfs or the
mkinitrd command supplied with your distribution.

Now reboot your system such that the newly built kernel is loaded.

Once the system is again up and running the next step is to build and install
SCST, iSCSI-SCST and scstadmin. With most distros (including RHEL 6) you can
do that by running the following command from the SCST directory:

  make scst scst_install iscsi iscsi_install scstadm scstadm_install

When using RHEL 5 or CentOS 5, use these commands instead:

  make enable_proc
  make scst scst_install iscsi iscsi_install scstadm scstadm_install

iSCSI-SCST includes the following components:
   * iscsi-scstd - daemon
   * man pages
   * Obsolete configuration files located under iscsi-scst/etc/obsolete, need to be copied to
     /etc if you want to use them. In iSCSI-SCST 2.0 it is recommended to use scstadmin
      and SCST sysfs interface for that:
      * initiators.allow - used for assigning specific initiators to targets
      * initiators.deny - used for assigning specific initiators to targets
      * iscsi-scstd.conf - list of targets and their properties

2. Set up /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi

The most convenient way to set up this file is to install the open-iscsi
package provided by your Linux distro first and then to run the shell commands
shown below. Verify the contents of the generated file.

  /etc/init.d/open-iscsi stop
  { echo "InitiatorName=$(if [ -e /usr/sbin/iscsi-iname ]; then /usr/sbin/iscsi-iname; else /sbin/iscsi-iname; fi)";
                          echo "InitiatorAlias=$(hostname)"; } >/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi
  /etc/init.d/open-iscsi start
  cat /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi

3. Set up /etc/scst.conf

The scst.conf configuration file is loaded at system boot time by the
shell script /etc/init.d/scst. The target, device and LUN
configuration is defined in this file.

Here is the sample config file. Copy it in /etc/scst.conf

HANDLER vdisk_fileio {
	DEVICE disk01 {
		filename /dev/ram0
		nv_cache 1
	}
	DEVICE disk02 {
		filename /dev/ram1
		nv_cache 1
	}
}

TARGET_DRIVER iscsi {
	enabled 1

	TARGET iqn.2006-10.net.vlnb:tgt {
		LUN 0 disk01
		LUN 1 disk02

		enabled 1
	}
}

Note that for each SCSI device LUN 0 must exist. This is required by the SCSI
protocol and is also documented in SCST's README file.

Then run the following command:

  /etc/init.d/scst start

You should have the working iSCSI-SCST now. Do the following steps if
you need to automatically configure it upon reboot.

4. Create soft links in /etc/init.d

This will make SCST to start automatically upon system boot. Use either
chkconfig or update-rc.d, depending on the Linux distribution you are using.
An example for Debian systems such as Ubuntu:

  update-rc.d scst defaults

On openSUSE you can let SCST start automatically through the following commands:

  insserv scst

5. Restart SCST and iSCSI-SCST

If you don't want to reboot now, you can make the above settings effective via
the following commands:

  /etc/init.d/scst restart


Installing and using iSCSI-SCST without using scstadmin via /sys interface
==========================================================================

First repeat steps 1 and 2 from the first section but leave out
"scstadm scstadm_install" from the make command in step 1.

Next load the scst_disk and scst_vdisk kernel modules as follows:

modprobe scst_disk
modprobe scst_vdisk
modprobe iscsi-scst
iscsi-scstd


Creating targets
----------------

echo "add_target iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1" > /sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/mgmt

This will add target iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1.


Changing targets' parameters
----------------------------

echo "8192" >/sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/MaxRecvDataSegmentLength

This will change MaxRecvDataSegmentLength parameter of target
iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1 to 8192.

You can read it then by:

# cat /sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/MaxRecvDataSegmentLength
8192
[key]

The mark "[key]" shows high level management tools, like scstadmin, that
this attribute has not default value. You can ignore it.


Add vdisk devices
-----------------

dd if=/dev/zero of=/disk1 bs=1M count=1024

This will create a backend file /disk1 for our future virtual device
disk1.

echo "add_device disk1 filename=/disk1; nv_cache=1" >/sys/kernel/scst_tgt/handlers/vdisk_fileio/mgmt

This will add new FILEIO device disk1 with backend file /disk1 and
NV_CACHE option enabled.


Selecting devices to be used by SCST
------------------------------------

You can see the list of available devices:

# ls -1 /sys/kernel/scst_tgt/devices
0:0:0:0
1:0:0:0
3:0:0:0
3:0:0:1
3:0:0:2
3:0:0:3
3:0:0:4
3:0:0:5
3:0:0:6
3:0:0:7
2:0:0:0
4:0:0:0
4:0:0:5
4:0:0:6
4:0:0:7
4:0:0:8
4:0:0:9
4:0:1:0
4:0:1:1
4:0:1:2
4:0:1:3
4:0:1:4
5:0:0:0
5:0:0:5
5:0:0:6
5:0:0:7
5:0:0:8
5:0:0:9
5:0:1:0
5:0:1:1
5:0:1:2
5:0:1:3
5:0:1:4
disk1


Defining LUN masking
--------------------

In order to associate specific LUNs with target
iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1, do the following:

echo "add 4:0:0:8 0" > /sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/luns/mgmt

This will assign the LUN 0 for pass-through device 4:0:0:8 to the target
iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1.

Note, you must have LUN 0 for each group. That's a SCSI requirement
(documented in SCST's README).

echo "add disk1 1 read_only=1" > /sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/luns/mgmt

This will assign the read only LUN 1 for virtual device disk1 to the
target iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1.


Deleting a LUN from a group
---------------------------

Run the following command:

echo "del X" > /sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/luns/mgmt

This will remove the LUN X from the target iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1.

For more information about LUN masking, refer to SCST README, section
"Access and devices visibility management (LUN masking)".


Enabling targets
----------------

After you created and configured target, you should enable it:

echo 1 >/sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/enabled

Then enable the iSCSI-SCST driver:

echo 1 >/sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/enabled


Assigning targets to specific initiators
----------------------------------------

In order to assign targets to specific initiators, you should use LUN
masking defined above. If an initiator assigned to an empty security
group of a target, the initiator will not see this target in the
SendTargets discovery and will not be able to connect to it.

Additionally, you can make the target be visible only via selected
portals using allowed_portal sysfs attribute. Read iSCSI-SCST's README
file for more details about this facility.


Installing and using iSCSI-SCST without using scstadmin via /proc interface
===========================================================================

First repeat steps 1 and 2 from the previous section but leave out
"scstadm scstadm_install" from the make command in step 1.

Next set up /etc/iscsi-scstd.conf

You can do this by e.g. running the following shell commands:

  echo "Target $(sed -n 's/InitiatorName=//p' /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi):storage" >/etc/iscsi-scstd.conf
  cat /etc/iscsi-scstd.conf

Next load the scst_disk kernel module as follows:

  modprobe scst_disk

The shell script /etc/init.d/iscsi-scst can now be used to start/stop/restart or
check the status of iSCSI-SCST.


Selecting devices to be used by SCST
------------------------------------

You can see the list of available devices:

# cat /proc/scsi_tgt/scsi_tgt
Device (host:ch:id:lun or name)                             Device handler

3:0:0:4                                                     dev_disk
3:0:0:5                                                     dev_disk
3:0:0:6                                                     dev_disk
3:0:0:7                                                     dev_disk
2:0:0:0                                                     none
4:0:0:0                                                     none
4:0:0:5                                                     dev_disk
4:0:0:6                                                     dev_disk
4:0:0:7                                                     dev_disk
4:0:0:8                                                     dev_disk
4:0:0:9                                                     dev_disk
4:0:1:0                                                     dev_disk
4:0:1:1                                                     dev_disk
4:0:1:2                                                     dev_disk
4:0:1:3                                                     dev_disk

5:0:0:0                                                     none
5:0:0:5                                                     dev_disk
5:0:0:6                                                     dev_disk
5:0:0:7                                                     dev_disk
5:0:0:8                                                     dev_disk
5:0:0:9                                                     dev_disk
5:0:1:0                                                     dev_disk
5:0:1:1                                                     dev_disk
5:0:1:2                                                     dev_disk
5:0:1:3                                                     dev_disk
5:0:1:4                                                     dev_disk


LUN masking
-----------

SCST defines security groups. For each group, you can add LUNs. 

If you want to have all LUNs available for all targets, just add them to
the "Default" group:

# echo "add 5:0:0:8 0" >/proc/scsi_tgt/groups/Default/devices
# cat /proc/scsi_tgt/groups/Default/devices
Device (host:ch:id:lun or name)                             Virtual lun  Options
5:0:0:8                                                        0

Now, the LUN "5:0:0:8" was added to the "Default" group as LUN #0.

Note, that you must have LUN 0. That's a SCSI requirement (documented in SCST's README).


Defining LUN masking
--------------------

In order to associate specific LUNs with specific targets, do the following:

   * Create a group for the target:

echo "add_group Default_iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1" >/proc/scsi_tgt/scsi_tgt

   * Add LUNs to the group:

echo "add 4:0:0:8 0" > /proc/scsi_tgt/groups/Default_iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/devices

This will assign the LUN "4:0:0:8" to the target iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1.
Again, you must have LUN 0 for each group.


Deleting a LUN from a group
---------------------------

Run the following command:

echo "del 4:0:0:8 0" > /proc/scsi_tgt/groups/Default_iqn.2007-05.com.example\:storage.iscsi-scst-1/devices

This will remove the LUN "4:0:0:8" from the target iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1.


Deleting a group
----------------

Run the following command:

echo "del_group Default_iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.iscsi-scst-1" >/proc/scsi_tgt/scsi_tgt

For more information about LUN masking, refer to SCST README, section
"Access and devices visibility management (LUN masking)".


Creating targets using iscsi-scstd.conf
---------------------------------------

The easiest way to create targets is to define them in
/etc/iscsi-scstd.conf. An example can be found in etc/iscsi-scstd.conf.
You need to have this file under /etc/ before starting iSCSI-SCST.


Assigning targets to specific initiators
----------------------------------------

In order to assign targets to specific initiators, you need to have
/etc/initiators.allow  and /etc/initiators.deny. You can find
example files in etc/initiators.allow and etc/initiators.deny.

Note that all targets are allowed to all initiators by default, so if
you want to use /etc/initiators.allow, you will need to have
/etc/initiators.deny that looks like this:

ALL ALL

This will deny all initiators expect for those defined in /etc/initiators.allow.

Useful examples of iscsi-scst-adm:

Show a specific target:

# iscsi-scst-adm --op show --tid=1
QueuedCommands=0

Show the configured parameters for a specific target:

# iscsi-scst-adm --op show --tid=1 --sid=0
InitialR2T=No
ImmediateData=Yes
MaxConnections=1
MaxRecvDataSegmentLength=2097152
MaxXmitDataSegmentLength=131072
MaxBurstLength=2097152
FirstBurstLength=262144
DefaultTime2Wait=2
DefaultTime2Retain=0
MaxOutstandingR2T=1
DataPDUInOrder=Yes
DataSequenceInOrder=Yes
ErrorRecoveryLevel=0
HeaderDigest=None
DataDigest=None
OFMarker=No
IFMarker=No
OFMarkInt=Reject
IFMarkInt=Reject
