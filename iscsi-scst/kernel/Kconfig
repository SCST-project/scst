	  ISCSI target driver for SCST. The iSCSI protocol has been defined in
	  RFC 3720. To use this target driver you will not only have to enable
	  this kernel module but you will also have to download the
	  corresponding user space daemon from http://scst.sourceforge.net.

config SCST_ISCSI_DEBUG_DIGEST_FAILURES
	bool "Simulate iSCSI digest failures"
	depends on SCST_ISCSI
	help
	  Simulates iSCSI digest failures in random places. Even when iSCSI
	  traffic is sent over a TCP connection, the 16-bit TCP checksum is too
	  weak for the requirements of a storage protocol. Furthermore, there
	  are also instances where the TCP checksum does not protect iSCSI
	  data, as when data is corrupted while being transferred on a PCI bus
	  or while in memory. The iSCSI protocol therefore defines a 32-bit CRC
	  digest on iSCSI packets in order to detect data corruption on an
	  end-to-end basis. CRCs can be used on iSCSI PDU headers and/or data.
	  Enabling this option allows to test digest failure recovery in the
	  iSCSI initiator that is talking to SCST.

	  If unsure, say "N".
