	  RFC 3720.

config SCST_ISCSI_DEBUG_DIGEST_FAILURES
	bool "Simulate iSCSI digest failures"
	depends on SCST_ISCSI
	help
	  Simulates iSCSI digest failures in random places. Even when iSCSI
	  traffic is sent over a TCP connection, the 16-bit TCP checksum is too
	  weak for the requirements of a storage protocol. Furthermore, there
	  are also instances where the TCP checksum does not protect iSCSI
	  data, as when data is corrupted while being transferred on a PCI bus
	  or while in memory. The iSCSI protocol therefore defines a 32-bit CRC
	  digest on iSCSI packets in order to detect data corruption on an
	  end-to-end basis. CRCs can be used on iSCSI PDU headers and/or data.
	  Enabling this option allows to test digest failure recovery in the
	  iSCSI initiator that is talking to SCST. If unsure, disable this
	  option.
