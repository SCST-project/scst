SCST Configuration/Administration scripts. Here you'll find scstadmin which reads
a configuration file /etc/scst.conf, or one if your choosing. With it you can manually
or automatically configure every aspect of SCST incuding enabling/disabling target mode
on your target SCSI controller. The old directory contains scst_db which uses a mysql
backend database to configure SCST but doesn't handle all the things scstadmin handles.
The perl module SCST::SCST is very generic and tries to handle error checking as well.

The init script was written for debian but should work on most distributions.

	scst-0.7.4	This is the SCST Perl module required by scstadmin and scst_db.

	scstadmin	Script which can accept operations on a command line or from
			a configuration file. See scst.conf. For command help,
				#> scstadmin

	old		Script which configures SCST using configurations
			found in a database. See the examples directory database
			schema and example data. You will need to edit the
			config file scst_db.conf to refect your environment.

	scst.conf	Configuration file for scst script. Usually stored
			in /etc.

	examples	Configuration examples.

	init.d/scst	Init script to start SCST on boot which uses scstadmin.


Installation:
=============

Installation is simple.

  #> make
  #> make install

This installs scstadmin, the init.d script and the perl module.


Getting Started:
================

The scstadmin script is much more functional than scst_db at this point but uses a
standard text-based config file. The original thought behind scst_db was to write
a daemon process which would except network connections and issue SCST commands. A
client app would then connect to that port. 

Copy scst.conf to /etc and edit it to your liking. if you have an existing configuration
then have scstadmin write it out to a config file for you:

  #> scstadmin -WriteConfig /etc/scst.conf

When removing devices, users or groups from the config file keep in mind that
"scstadmin -config" will NOT remove those configurations from the running system unless
you use the -ForceConfig flag. Also, using the init script to reload the configuration

  #> /etc/init.d/scst reload-config

will also not remove configurations from a running system.
