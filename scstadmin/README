SCST Configuration/Administration scripts. Here you'll find scstadmin which reads
a configuration file /etc/scst.conf, or one if your choosing. With it you can manually
or automatically configure every aspect of SCST incuding enabling/disabling target mode
on your target SCSI controller. The old directory contains scst_db which uses a mysql
backend database to configure SCST but doesn't handle all the things scstadmin handles.
The perl module SCST::SCST is very generic and tries to handle error checking as well.

The init script was written for debian but should work on most distributions.


	scstadmin.sysfs
			Use this version if you've disabled procfs support in SCST.
	scstadmin.procfs
			This is the default version which uses the older procfs.

	scst-0.8.22	This is the SCST Perl module required by scstadmin and scst_db.
	scst-0.9.00	This is the SCST Perl module to be used with SCST compiled
                        for sysfs. Note, the current version of scstadmin will NOT yet
                        work with this module.

	scstadmin	Script which can accept operations on a command line or from
			a configuration file. See scst.conf. For command help,
				#> scstadmin

	scst.conf	Configuration file for scst script. Usually stored
			in /etc.

	examples	Configuration examples.

	init.d/scst	Init script to start SCST on boot which uses scstadmin.


INSTALLING
----------

Now do the normal:

make
make install

This installs scstadmin, the init.d script and the perl module. If you want SCST to
startup and configure automatically upon boot, enable SCST using your favorite
SysV init editor.

NOTE: The init.d startup & shutdown scripts now depend on lsb-core. Ensure you have
lsb-core installed or 'make install' will fail. Make sure /usr/lib/lsb/install_initd
exists.


GETTING HELP
------------

The new scstadmin has many more options than the olde procfs version to see
them, type:

scstadmin --help


CONVERTING FROM PROCFS (scst version 1.x)
-----------------------------------------

The new scstadmin uses a different configuration file format. However,
scstadmin will convert your old configuration file for you. No special
arguments are required, simply:

scstadmin -config <old config file>

Take note of warnings issued by scstadmin. Manually fix configuration
errors using scstadmin. Once you're satisfied your running configuration is
what you expect, save it by typing:

scstadmin -write_config <new config file>

Be sure to review this new configuration file to ensure it matches.


CREATING A CONFIGURATION FROM SCRATCH
-------------------------------------

* DEVICES *

Devices are defined by their handler. Commonly used handlers are dev_disk,
dev_cdrom, vdisk_fileio, vdisk_blockio and vcdrom.

To list all the available handlers, type:

scstadmin -list_handler

Physical devices used for passthrough handlers like dev_disk and dev_cdrom
are defined by their H:C:I:L :

HANDLER dev_disk {
	DEVICE 1:0:0:0
}

HANDLER dev_cdrom {
	DEVICE 2:0:0:0
}

Virtual devices are opened through special CREATE attributes. For example, a 
virtual disk named "disk1" pointing to a disk partition /dev/hda1 would be look
like:

HANDLER vdisk_fileio {
	DEVICE disk1 {
		filename /dev/hda1
	}
}

To list all the available CREATE attributes for a given handler, type:

scstadmin -list_hnd_attr <handler>

* ASSIGNING DEVICES TO TARGET AND INITIATORS *

Now we can assign the device to a target driver. To get a list of available
drivers, type:

scstadmin -list_driver

To list all available targets, type:

scstadmin -list_target

Now we can build our configuration assigning disk1 to LUN 0 for all initiators:

TARGET_DRIVER qla2x00t {
	TARGET 25:00:00:f0:98:87:92:f3 {
		LUN 0 disk1

		enabled 1
	}
}

NOTE: We added the attribute "enabled" and set it to "1". Without this attribute
set to 1, this target will be disabled and no initiators have access to its
LUNs.

This assigns disk1 to LUN 0 using default attributes. To list all available LUN
CREATE attributes, type:

scstadmin -list_tgt_attr <target> -driver <driver>

An example would be to use the CREATE attribute "read_only" to force the LUN to
be read-only:

TARGET_DRIVER qla2x00t {
	TARGET 25:00:00:f0:98:87:92:f3 {
		LUN 0 disk1 {
			read_only 1
		}

		# Assign LUN 1 to passthrough device 1:0:0:0
		LUN 1 1:0:0:0

		enabled 1
	}
}

Since LUNs 0 and 1 will now be available to all targets, we may want to
establish groups to restrict which LUNs are available to which initiators.
To do that, we use the GROUP clause within the TARGET clause:

TARGET_DRIVER qla2x00t {
	TARGET 25:00:00:f0:98:87:92:f3 {
		GROUP production {
			LUN 0 disk1 {
				read_only 1
			}

			INITIATOR 25:00:00:f0:99:87:94:a3
		}

		GROUP development {
			LUN 0 1:0:0:0
			INITIATOR 25:00:00:f0:99:87:94:a4
		}

		# Allow a CDROM device to be LUN 1 for all initiators
		LUN 1 2:0:0:0

		enabled 1
	}
}

For drivers which support virtual targets, like iSCSI, scstadmin will simply
create them on the fly:

TARGET_DRIVER iscsi {
	enabled 1

	IncomingUser "joe 12charsecret"

	TARGET iqn.2006-10.net.vlnb:tgt {
		IncomingUser "joe 12charsecret"

		LUN 0 disk1

		enabled 1
	}
}

Notice we included a new attribute "IncomingUser" This is a dynamic attribute
which allows an initiator to scan for LUNs, if added at the driver level, and
attach to LUNs if added at the target level. To retrieve a list of available
driver dynamic attributes, type:

scstadmin -list_drv_attr <driver>

To retrieve a list of available target dynamic attributes, type:

scstadmin -list_tgt_attr <target> -driver <driver>

Other attributes called non-key attributes may also be defined, assuming they
are writable. These can be listed using any of the above -list commands using
the extra -nonkey option:

scstadmin -list_tgt_attr <target> -driver <driver> -nonkey

* EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION *

A complete configuration using the above examples would look like:

HANDLER dev_disk {
	DEVICE 1:0:0:0
}

HANDLER dev_cdrom {
	DEVICE 2:0:0:0
}

HANDLER vdisk_fileio {
	DEVICE disk1 {
		filename /dev/hda1
	}
}

TARGET_DRIVER qla2x00t {
	TARGET 25:00:00:f0:98:87:92:f3 {
		GROUP production {
			LUN 0 disk1 {
				read_only 1
			}

			INITIATOR 25:00:00:f0:99:87:94:a3
		}

		GROUP development {
			LUN 0 1:0:0:0
			INITIATOR 25:00:00:f0:99:87:94:a4
		}

		# Allow a CDROM device to be LUN 1 for all initiators
		LUN 1 2:0:0:0

		enabled 1
	}
}

TARGET_DRIVER iscsi {
	enabled 1

	IncomingUser "joe 12charsecret"

	TARGET iqn.2006-10.net.vlnb:tgt {
		IncomingUser "joe 12charsecret"

		LUN 0 disk1

		enabled 1
	}
}
