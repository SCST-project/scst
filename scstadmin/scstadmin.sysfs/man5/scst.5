.SH NAME
scst \- /etc/init.d/scst configuration file.
.SH DESCRIPTION
/etc/default/scst is a configuration file read by the SCST startup script
/etc/init.d/scst and contains zero or more variables that control the behavior
of that startup script. Currently there is only one such variable,
SCST_TARGET_MODULES, and it only has to be set when using the procfs interface.
.P
The format of the
.I scst
file is as follows:
.br
- Blank lines and lines starting with a hash sign (#) are ignored.
.br
- All other lines must contain a variable definition using the syntax
<name>=<value>. If <value> contains blanks, it must be
surrounded with double quotes.
.P
An example:
.IP
# When using the procfs interface, the /etc/init.d/scst script
.br
# cannot derive from /etc/scst.conf which target modules will
.br
# be used and hence these have to be specified explicitly.
.br
SCST_TARGET_MODULES="scst_local iscsi_scst ib_srpt"
