SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) Target driver for Linux
=================================================

Introduction
------------

The SRP target driver has been designed to work on top of the Linux
InfiniBand kernel drivers. While all recent Linux distributions
include recent versions of the InfiniBand drivers, the only way to
obtain the latest available InfiniBand drivers is by installing the
OFED software stack.

The OFED stack is distributed by the OpenFabrics Alliance (OFA). The
mission of the OpenFabrics Alliance is to is to develop, distribute
and promote a unified, transport-independent, open-source software
stack for RDMA-capable fabrics and networks, including InfiniBand and
Ethernet.

Note: because during OFED installation the distro-provided InfiniBand
kernel drivers are replaced, doing so voids the support contract
offered by your Linux distributor.

Please follow the instructions below carefully. Skipping a step may
result in kernel modules that fail to load, a kernel oops or even a
system that does no longer boot.


Verifying the kernel version
----------------------------

Before installing the OFED distribution, it is very important to check
the OFED release notes. Each OFED distribution has been tested
carefully, but only against the kernel versions specified in
docs/OFED_release_notes.txt (you can find this document in the OFED
distribution). Make sure that you are using a supported kernel / OFED
combination. As an example, if you want to use OFED 1.5.1 on an Ubuntu
system, you will have to start with replacing the Ubuntu kernel by a
kernel from kernel.org since OFED 1.5.1 has not been tested on any
Ubuntu kernel.


Compiling SRP against OFED
--------------------------

Make sure that all necessary packages needed for kernel compilation
have been installed (kernel headers, gcc, binutils, ...).

Unload any loaded InfiniBand drivers:

  /etc/init.d/opensmd stop
  /etc/init.d/openibd stop

Remove any distro-provided InfiniBand drivers:

  rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/infiniband
  rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/net/mlx4

Now locate the file Makefile.lib and patch it such that it supports
the variable PRE_CFLAGS:

  if [ -e /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/scripts/Makefile.lib ]; then
    cd /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build
  else
    cd /usr/src/linux-$(uname -r | sed 's/\(-default\|-trace\|-xen\)$//;s/\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.PTF$//')
  fi
  patch -p1 < ${SCST_DIR}/srpt/patches/kernel-${KV}-pre-cflags.patch

Next, download and install the OFED package. Make sure to disable
OFED's SRP target driver (srpt=n) and to enable at least the
kernel-ib, kernel-ib-devel and SRP tools packages. An example:

  wget http://www.openfabrics.org/downloads/OFED/ofed-1.5.1/OFED-1.5.1.tgz
  tar xzf OFED-1.5.1.tgz
  cd OFED-1.5.1
  cat <<EOF >ofed.conf
  libibverbs=y                                          
  libibverbs-utils=y                                    
  libmthca=y                                            
  libmlx4=y                                             
  libcxgb3=y
  libnes=y
  libipathverbs=y
  librdmacm=y
  librdmacm-utils=y
  mstflint=y
  ofed-docs=y
  ofed-scripts=y
  kernel-ib=y
  kernel-ib-devel=y
  ibvexdmtools=y
  qlgc_vnic_daemon=y
  core=y
  mthca=y
  mlx4=y
  mlx4_en=y
  cxgb3=y
  nes=y
  ipath=y
  ipoib=y
  opensm=y
  opensm-libs=y
  srpt=n
  srptools=y
  perftest=y
  EOF
  ./install.pl -c ofed.conf  

Now continue with the installation instructions you can find in the
SCST-SRPT README file. The Makefile included with SCST-SRPT detects
whether OFED has been installed, and if so, compiles SCST-SRPT with
the OFED kernel headers instead of with the regular kernel headers.
