SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) Target driver for Linux
=================================================

The SRP target driver has been designed to work on top of the Linux
InfiniBand kernel drivers -- either the InfiniBand drivers included
with a Linux distribution of the OFED InfiniBand drivers. For more
information about using the SRP target driver in combination with
OFED, see also README.ofed.

The SRP target driver has been implemented as an SCST driver. This
makes it possible to support a lot of I/O modes on real and virtual
devices. A few examples of supported device handlers are:

1. scst_disk. This device handler implements transparent pass-through
   of SCSI commands and allows SRP to access and to export real
   SCSI devices, i.e. disks, hardware RAID volumes, tape libraries
   as SRP LUNs.

2. scst_vdisk, either in fileio or in blockio mode. This device handler
   allows to export software RAID volumes, LVM volumes, IDE disks, and
   normal files as SRP LUNs.

3. nullio. The nullio device handler allows to measure the performance
   of the SRP target implementation without performing any actual I/O.


Installation
------------

Proceed as follows to compile and install the SRP target driver:

1. The SRP initiator (ib_srp) included with Linux kernel 2.6.36 and before
   frequently makes ib_srpt send BUSY responses, which hurts performance.
   This can be avoided by making SCST's SCSI command queue size identical
   to that of the initiator by applying the scst_increase_max_tgt_cmds patch:

   cd ${SCST_DIR}
   patch -p0 < srpt/patches/scst_increase_max_tgt_cmds.patch

   This patch increases SCST's per-device queue size from 48 to 64. This
   helps to avoid BUSY conditions because the size of the transmit
   queue in Linux' SRP initiator is also 64.

   Note: avoiding BUSY conditions is also possible by limiting the number of
   outstanding requests on the initiator. This is possible either by setting
   nr_requests low enough or by enabling the dynamic queue depth adjustment
   feature. Dynamic queue depth adjustment is available from kernel version
   2.6.33 on.  See also scst/README for more information.

2. Now compile and install SRPT:

   cd ${SCST_DIR}
   make -s scst_clean scst scst_install
   make -s srpt_clean srpt srpt_install
   make -s scstadm scstadm_install

3. Edit the installed file /etc/init.d/scst and add ib_srpt to the
   SCST_MODULES variable.

4. Configure SCST such that it will be started during system boot:

   chkconfig scst on

The ib_srpt kernel module supports the following parameters:
* srp_max_req_size (number)
  Maximum size of an SRP control message in bytes. Examples of SRP control
  messages are: login request, logout request, data transfer request, ...
  The larger this parameter, the more scatter/gather list elements can be
  sent at once. Use the following formula to compute an appropriate value
  for this parameter: 68 + 16 * (sg_tablesize). The default value of
  this parameter is 4148, which corresponds to an sg table size of 255.
* srp_max_rsp_size (number)
  Maximum size of an SRP response message in bytes. Sense data is sent back
  via these messages towards the initiator. The default size is 256 bytes.
  With this value there remains (256-36) = 220 bytes for sense data.
* srp_max_rdma_size (number)
  Maximum number of bytes that may be transferred at once via RDMA. Defaults
  to 65536 bytes, which is sufficient to use the full bandwidth of low-latency
  HCAs. Increasing this value may decrease latency for applications
  transferring large amounts of data at once.
* srpt_srq_size (number, default 4095)
  ib_srpt uses a shared receive queue (SRQ) for processing incoming SRP
  requests. This number may have to be increased when a large number of
  initiator systems is accessing a single SRP target system.
* srpt_sq_size (number, default 4096)
  Per-channel InfiniBand send queue size. The default setting is sufficient
  for a credit limit of 128. Changing this parameter to a smaller value may
  cause RDMA requests to be retried and hence may slow down data transfer
  severely.
* thread (0, 1 or 2, default 1)
  Defines the context on which SRP requests are processed:
  * thread=0: do as much processing in IRQ context as possible. Results in
    lower latency than the other two modes but may trigger soft lockup
    complaints when multiple initiators are simultaneously processing
    workloads with large I/O depths. Scalability of this mode is limited
    - it exploits only a fraction of the power available on multiprocessor
    systems.
  * thread=1: dedicates one kernel thread per initiator. Scales well on
    multiprocessor systems. This is the recommended mode when multiple
    initiator systems are accessing the same target system simultaneously.
  * thread=2: makes one CPU process all IB completions and defer further
    processing to kernel thread context. Scales better than mode thread=0 but
    not as good as mode thread=1. May trigger soft lockup complaints when
    multiple initiators are simultaneously processing workloads with large I/O
    depths.
* trace_flag (unsigned integer, only available in debug builds)
  The individual bits of the trace_flag parameter define which categories of
  trace messages should be sent to the kernel log and which ones not.


Configuring the SRP Target System
---------------------------------

First of all, create the file /etc/scst.conf. You can create this file with
the scstadmin tool as follows:

  /etc/init.d/scst stop
  /etc/init.d/scst start

Now configure SCST using scstadmin - see also the scstadmin documentation for
further information. Once finished, save the configuration to /etc/scst.conf:

  scstadmin -write_config /etc/scst.conf  (sysfs version)
or
  scstadmin -WriteConfig /etc/scst.conf   (procfs version)

One can verify the contents of scst.conf e.g. as follows:

  cat /etc/scst.conf

Now verify that loading the configuration from file works correctly:

  /etc/init.d/scst reload


Configuring the SRP Initiator System
------------------------------------

First of all, load the SRP kernel module as follows:

   modprobe ib_srp

Next, discover the new SRP target by running the ibsrpdm command:

   ibsrpdm -c

If you want to let the initiator system log in to all SRP targets available
in the same InfiniBand subnet that is possible as follows:

   ibsrpdm -c | while read target_info; do echo "${target_info}" > /sys/class/infiniband_srp/${SRP_HCA_NAME}/add_target; done

If you want to let the initiator log in to a specific target you can do that
e.g. as follows:

   echo "id_ext=0002c903000f1366,ioc_guid=0002c903000f1366,dgid=fe800000000000000002c903000f1367,pkey=ffff,service_id=0002c903000f1366" > /sys/class/infiniband_srp/${SRP_HCA_NAME}/add_target; done

The meaning of the parameters in the above command is as follows:
   * id_ext: must match ioc_guid.
   * ioc_guid: see also the documentation of the ib_srpt ioc_guid parameter.
   * dgid: target HCA port GID to connect to.
   * pkey: IB partition key (P_Key) of the target to connect to.
   * service_id: must match ioc_guid.

Target GIDs can be queried e.g. via sysfs:

$ for f in /sys/devices/*/*/*/infiniband/*/ports/*/gids/0; do echo $f; \
cat $f | cut -c21- | sed 's/://g'; done
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/1/gids/0
0002c9030005f34b
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/2/gids/0
0002c9030005f34c
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0/0000:05:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_1/ports/1/gids/0
0002c9030003cca7
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0/0000:05:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_1/ports/2/gids/0
0002c9030003cca8

Finally run lsscsi to display the details of the newly discovered SCSI disks:

   lsscsi

SRP targets can be recognized in the output of lsscsi by looking for
the disk names assigned on the SCST target ("disk01" in the example below):

   [8:0:0:0]    disk    SCST_FIO disk01            102  /dev/sdb


Target names
------------

The name assigned by the ib_srpt target driver to an SCST target is the node
GUID of a HCA in hexadecimal form with a colon after every fourth digit. The
HCA node GUIDs can be obtained via the ibv_devices command, the ibv_devinfo
command or via sysfs. An example:

# ibv_devices
    device                 node GUID
    ------              ----------------
    mlx4_1              0002c9030003cca2
    mlx4_0              0002c9030005f34e

# head /sys/devices/*/*/*/infiniband/*/node_guid
==> /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_0/node_guid <==
0002:c903:0005:f34e

==> /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0/0000:05:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_1/node_guid <==
0002:c903:0003:cca2

Once the ib_srpt driver has been loaded there will be SCST targets available
with the HCA node GUID as name:

# ls /sys/bus/scst_target/drivers/ib_srpt/0*
0002:c903:0003:cca2  0002:c903:0005:f34e

If you need deprecated target names in form ib_srpt_target_X, you should
set use_node_guid_in_target_name parameter of module ib_srpt to 0.

To move from the deprecated ib_srpt_target_X layout you should replace
in your scst.conf all ib_srpt_target_X to the corresponding ports names,
like ib_srpt_target_0 to 0002:c902:0022:16f4, if ibv_devices reported
for this port/node GUID 0002c902002216f4.


Session names
-------------

The ib_srpt target driver uses the 128-bit SRP initiator port identifier for
the session name. This identifier is sent by the SRP initiator to the SRP
target via the SRP_LOGIN_REQ information unit. The Linux SRP initiator
(ib_srp) generates the initiator port identifier as follows:
- The first eight bytes are the identifier extension ('initiator_ext' parameter
  specified in the login string echoed into the sysfs file 'add_target').
- The last eight bytes are the GUID of the initiator HCA port used to
  communicate with the target.

An example:

[ INITIATOR ]

$ for f in /sys/devices/*/*/*/infiniband/*/ports/*/gids/0; do echo
f; cat $f | cut -c21-; done
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/1/gids/0
0002:c903:0005:f34b
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/2/gids/0
0002:c903:0005:f34c
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0/0000:05:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_1/ports/1/gids/0
0002:c903:0003:cca7
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0/0000:05:00.0/infiniband/mlx4_1/ports/2/gids/0
0002:c903:0003:cca8

[ TARGET, after login ]

$ ls /sys/bus/scst_target/drivers/ib_srpt/*/sessions
/sys/bus/scst_target/drivers/ib_srpt/0002:c903:0003:cca2/sessions:
0x00000000000000000002c9030003cca7

/sys/bus/scst_target/drivers/ib_srpt/0002:c903:0005:f34e/sessions:
0x00000000000000000002c9030005f34b


High availability
-----------------

If there are redundant paths in the IB network between initiator and target,
automatic path failover can be set up on the initiator as follows:
* Edit /etc/infiniband/openib.conf to load the SRP driver and SRP HA daemon
  automatically: set SRP_LOAD=yes and SRPHA_ENABLE=yes.
* To set up and use the high availability feature you need the dm-multipath
  driver and multipath tool.
* Please refer to the OFED-1.x user manual for more detailed instructions
  on how to enable and how to use the HA feature. See e.g.
  http://www.mellanox.com/related-docs/prod_software/Mellanox_OFED%20_Linux_user_manual_1_5_1_2.pdf.

A setup with automatic failover between redundant targets is possible by
installing and configuring DRBD on both targets. If the initiator system
supports mirroring (e.g. Linux), you can use the following approach:
* Configure DRBD in Active/Active mode.
* Configure the initiator(s) for mirroring between the redundant targets.
If the initiator system does not support mirroring (e.g. VMware ESX), you
can use the following approach:
* Configure DRBD in Active/Passive mode and enable STONITH mode in the
  Heartbeat software.

Notes about ib_srpt
-------------------

* Unloading the kernel module ib_srpt while I/O is ongoing is supported.
  However, it can take up to two minutes before unloading finishes. During
  that time CPU usage will be high.


Performance Notes - Initiator Side
----------------------------------

* For latency sensitive applications, using the noop scheduler at the initiator
  side can give significantly better results than with other schedulers.

* The following parameters have a small but measurable impact on SRP
  performance:
  * /sys/class/block/${dev}/queue/rotational
  * /sys/class/block/${dev}/queue/rq_affinity
  * /proc/irq/${ib_int_no}/smp_affinity
