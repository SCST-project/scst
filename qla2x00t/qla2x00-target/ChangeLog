   Halsadi!

   using .config option CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX_TARGET_DISABLE_INI_MODE.


Summary of changes between versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2
---------------------------------------------------

 - Failure of enabling target mode, if do it too fast, fixed
   Based on work by sdrb <sdrb@onet.eu>

   module unload fixed

 - Implemented abort on timeout of stuck in the firmware commands


Summary of changes between versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1

 - Fixed possible crash if tgt module rmmod'ed under load

 - Fixed incorrect residual on internal BUSY replies

 - Updated to work on 2.6.23.x

 - Fixes a race, when an event comes on the driver unload, so DPC thread
   will try to use already half destroyed data.

-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x+, including 2.6.16-prex)

 - Fixed problem when "out-of-order frames rassembly" bit was wrongly set,
   which lead to only 1Gbps speed of 23xx cards.

 - Removed all code that deals with "use_sg == 0" data, since staring
   from SCST 0.9.5 commands data are always in SG-vector. 

 - Fixed hungup on the module unload.

 - Minor cleanups and fixes


Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.7 and 0.9.3.8
-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x+, including 2.6.16-prex)

 - Minor cleanups


Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.6 and 0.9.3.7
-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x+, including 2.6.16-prex)

 - Fix null pointer dereference in do_ctio_complete (thanks to Calvin Morrow)


Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.5 and 0.9.3.6
-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x+, including 2.6.16-prex)

- Fixed possible race during initial enabling of Target Mode (thanks to 
Mark Buechler for finding)

	
Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.4 and 0.9.3.5
-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x)
	
 - Reset chip when switching from initiator to initator/target and back
implemented
	
 - Use 2K loop_id's for 23xx chips and thus change how sessions are
tracked.

 - Added Module Info

 - Fixed module counting with initiator module preventing it from going
away w/out telling us (pointed out by Vladislav Bolkhovitin)

 - Some minor debugging changes


Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.2 of old driver and 0.9.3.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Support for the latest in-tree Qlogic initiator added by Nathaniel
Clark

 - Only one module is build and it interacts with a patched kernel
qla2xxx driver. The single module is called qla2x00tgt.ko instead of
having one for each driver type.

 - Target mode can be enabled via a sysfs interface on a per card basis.
Under the appropriate scsi_host there is now an entry
target_mode_enabled, which can read and written.
