Known issues and unimplemented features
---------------------------------------

 - NPIV targets not quite work. If you need NPIV, use QLogic git driver

 - Minor "ToDo"'s spread in the code.

Very old and, probably, already fixed:

 - If a Linux initiator asks for devices using INQUIRY command too soon
   before the controller on the 23xx target is fully initialized in the
   target mode, the initiator could receive garbage devices and the
   messages "scsi: unknown device type 31" will be printed in the kernel
   log on the initiator. After rescan on the initiator (eg by
   rmmod/modprobe the driver) the correct devices will be added instead
   of the garbage ones. This is actually Linux SCSI mid-level's problem
   (although also could be the Qlogic firmware's one): type 31 is
   "unknown or no device type", but the SCSI mid-level treats such
   devices as real and adds them to the system. To avoid it, try to
   leave the target enough time for initialization (some 10th seconds).
   With the latest firmware that might be fixed.

 - On 23xx if on a tape with block size 0 we write block with size X
   and then read it with bs <X the tape skips all blocks with size X
   until the next correct block or filemark found, instead of returning
   ILI with negative counter. Looks like the initiator retries the
   command quietly. 22xx works correctly. With the latest firmware that
   might be fixed.
