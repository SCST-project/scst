	help
	  This qla2xxx driver supports all QLogic Fibre Channel
	  PCI and PCIe host adapters.

	  By default, firmware for the ISP parts will be loaded
	  via the Firmware Loader interface.

	  ISP               Firmware Filename
	  ----------        -----------------
	  21xx              ql2100_fw.bin
	  22xx              ql2200_fw.bin

	  25xx              ql2500_fw.bin

	  Upon request, the driver caches the firmware image until
	  the driver is unloaded.

	  Firmware images can be retrieved from:

config SCSI_QLA2XXX_TARGET
	bool "QLogic 2xxx target mode support"
	depends on SCSI_QLA_FC
	default y
	help
	  This option enables target mode hooks used by the SCST qla2x00t
	  driver. Once qla2x00tgt module is loaded, target mode for each
	  port can be enable via sysfs interface.

	  You will also need the SCST middle level for qla2x00t.

config SCST_QLA_TGT_ADDON
	tristate "QLogic 2XXX Target Mode Add-On"
	depends on SCST && SCSI_QLA_FC && SCSI_QLA2XXX_TARGET
	default SCST
	help
	  Target mode add-on driver for QLogic 2xxx Fibre Channel host adapters.
	  Visit http://scst.sourceforge.net for more info about this driver.

config QLA_TGT_DEBUG_WORK_IN_THREAD
	bool "Use threads context only"
	depends on SCST_QLA_TGT_ADDON
	help
	  Makes SCST process incoming commands from the qla2x00t target
	  driver and call the driver's callbacks in internal SCST
	  threads context instead of SIRQ context, where thise commands
	  were received. Useful for debugging and lead to some
	  performance loss.

	  If unsure, say "N".

config QLA_TGT_DEBUG_SRR
	bool "SRR debugging"
	depends on SCST_QLA_TGT_ADDON
	help
	  Turns on retransmitting packets (SRR)
	  debugging. In this mode some CTIOs will be "broken" to force the
	  initiator to issue a retransmit request. Useful for debugging and lead to big
	  performance loss.

	  If unsure, say "N".
