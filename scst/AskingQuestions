Before asking any questions directly or in scst-devel mailing list make
sure that you read *ALL* relevant documentation files (at least, 2
README files: one for SCST and one for the target driver you are using)
and *understood* *ALL* written there. I personally very much like
working with people who understand what they are doing and hate when
somebody tries to use me as a replacement for his brain to save his time
on expense of mine. So, in such cases it shouldn't be a surprise if your
question will not be answered or will be answered in the RTFM style.

See a very good guide "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" in
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html.

Sorry, if the above might sound too harsh. Unfortunately, we, SCST
developers, have limited abilities and can't waste them keeping
explaining basic concepts and answering on the same questions again and
again.

Examples of too FAQ areas are "What are those aborts and resets, which
your target from time to time logging, mean and what to do with them?",
"Do they relate to I/O stalls I sometimes experience" and "Why after
them my device was put offline?".

So, as a bottom line, don't ask questions answers on which you can find
out yourself by a simple documentation reading and minimal thinking
effort.

If you experience kernel crash, hang, etc., you should follow
REPORTING-BUGS file from your kernel source tree.

For most questions it is very desirable if you attach to your message
full kernel log from the target since it's booted. Note, *SINCE IT
BOOTED*. Please don't try to be smart and filter out what's you
think isn't needed. What's usually removed could allow us to see the
target and SCST configurations.

Please, NEVER send dmesg output without timestamps, because timestamps
are very important to see the whole picture. You should either enable
CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME kernel compile option, or use kernel logs your system
logger stored for you in /var/log. In case if you enabled a trace option
producing a lot of log data, you should make NOT CORRUPTED logs as
described in section "Dealing with massive logs" of the SCST README.

Example of a really bad question:

======================================================================

In our user space driver , i use epoll_wait to wait on multiple file
descriptors for multiple devices. Apparently when i wait on the ioctl in
blocking mode , everything works well , but when i wait on epoll , and
try to  attach a target device , i get immediately a "Bad address" error
value from the epoll.

What is the reason ?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This question is bad, because, apparently, the author was doing
something wrong with epoll, but instead of checking the scst_user source
code to find out when "Bad address" error can be returned and understand
possible reasons for it, he expected others to do that for him. He even
didn't bothered to look in the kernel log, where, very probably, the
reason of the error was logged.


Here are three examples of good questions:

======================================================================

I'm looking for a help in understanding of SCST internal architecture
and operation. The problem I'm experiencing now is that SCST seems to
process deferred commands incorrectly in some cases. More specifically,
I'm confused with the 'while' loop in scst_send_to_midlev function.

As far as I understand, the basic execution path consists of a call to
scst_do_send_midlev followed by taking of a decision on this command
(continue with this command, reschedule it, or move to the next one),
the decision is stored in 'int res', which is then returned from the
function.

However, if there are deferred commands on the device, the function does
not return but makes another call to scst_do_send_to_midlev, analyzes
the return code again and stores the decision in 'int res' thereby
erasing the decision for the previous command. If scst_send_to_midlev
exits now, it will return the _new_ decision (for the deferred command)
whereas the scst_process_active_cmd will think that it is the decision
for the command that was originally passed to scst_send_to_midlev.

For example, this will cause problems in the following situation:
1. scst_send_to_midlev is called with cmd == 0x80000100
2. scst_do_send_to_midlev is called with cmd == 0x8000100
3. scst_do_send_to_midlev returns with SCST_EXEC_COMPLETED
   (in certain scenarios the command is already destroyed at this point)
4. scst_check_deferred_commands finds the deferred cmd == 0x80000200
5. scst_do_send_to_midlev is called with cmd == 0x80000200
6. scst_do_send_to_midlev returns with SCST_EXEC_NEED_THREAD
7. scst_send_to_midlev returns with SCST_CMD_STATE_RES_NEED_THREAD
8. Now, the scst_process_active_cmd will try to reschedule command 0x8000100
   which is already destroyed at this point !
   
Can anyone on the list confirm my guess? Or, this situation should never
happen because of some other condition which I may have missed? Right
now I can't think of any of simple methods to work around the issue,
i.e. any of my ideas require rewriting significant part of the code.

======================================================================

Hello,

I have two machines (SCST targets) with the following parameters:
- two dual core Xeon CPUs
- QLA2342 FC HBA
- Areca SATA RAID HBA
- Linux 2.6.21.3, running in 64 bit mode with 16G RAM
- SCST trunk version

On the client side there is a Solaris 10 U3 machine, with the same (chip 
wise) Qlogic controller.

There is an FC switch between the three machines, and each of the 
targets are zoned to the client's port in a one-by-one manner, so HBA 
port 1 sees only target 1 and port 2 sees only target 2.

The targets are configured with two large sparse files on XFS (8 TB 
each, with dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1M count=0 seek=8388608).

In Solaris I do various tests with SVM (Sun's built in volume manager) 
and multiterabyte UFS. Occasionally, there are some strange write
errors, where the volume  manager drops its volumes and without a VM, a
simple UFS fs write can  fail too.

I see various errors logged by the kernel (Solaris'), these are some 
examples, both with and without SVM:

I don't see anything in the dmesg on the target side.

After these errors SCST seems to be dead. I can't unload its modules and 
can't communicate it via /proc.
A simple cat vdisk just waits and waits.

Could you please help? What should I set/collect/send in this case to 
help resolving this issue?

======================================================================

Hello,

I am trying to get scst working on an Opteron machine.

After some hours, playing with different kernel versions and different
missing functions, I've sticked with a 2.6.15 and a
drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c hack from 2.6.14, which contains the
scsi_wait_req. (Linux is a mess, each point release changes something.
How can developers keep up with this?)

Now everything seems to be OK, I could load the modules and such.

I have a setup of two machines connected to each other in an FC-P2P
manner. The two machines has two 2G links between them. On the initiator
side I have FreeBSD, because I know that better and this is what I did
some target mode tests.

The strange thing is that the loop seems to be only running at 1 Gbps:

The device is there, but I cannot use it.

BTW, the target mode machine (Linux) runs on a dual Opteron in 64 bit
mode, with 8GB of RAM. I've lowered it with mem=800M, but the effect is
the same.

Assuming that mixed 2.6.14-.15 kernel is the fault, could you please
tell me what version should I use, for which all of the patches will
work?
