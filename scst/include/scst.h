 *   initiator_name - remote initiator's name, any NULL-terminated string,

 *      control group. Could be NULL, then "default" group is used.
 *      The groups are set up via /proc interface.
 *   data - any target driver supplied data

 * Note: A session creation and initialization is a complex task,

 *       Those commands processing will be delayed inside SCST until
 *       the session initialization is finished, then their processing
 *       will be restarted. The target driver will be notified about
 *       finish of the session initialization by function result_fn().
 *       On success the target driver could do nothing, but if the
 *       initialization fails, the target driver must ensure that
 *       no more new commands being sent or will be sent to SCST after
 *       result_fn() returns. All already sent to SCST commands for
 *       failed session will be returned in xmit_response() with BUSY status.

 *
 * - It is highly recommended to call scst_unregister_session() as soon as it
