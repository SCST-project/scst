Summary of changes between versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1
---------------------------------------------------

 - Support for descriptor sense format added

 - Makefiles made more packager friendly (Ruben Laban)

 - Support for variable length CDB added

 - Support for Async. Event Notifications added
 
 - Implemented "plug-and-play" notifications about new devices in security
   groups, deleted devices from security groups and changed size of a
   device. They can be delivered either through AENs (if supported), or
   Unit Attentions.
  
 - New command "resync_size" added to scst_vdisk proc interface to tell
   scst_vdisk to reread size of the corresponding device after it was
   changed

 - Added pattern matching for initiator names in SCST access control
   (Gennadiy Nerubayev)

 - Now only sent for execution commands are counted to wait for in TM
   commands, which made processing of TM commands faster

 - Now devices blocked only in reset TM commands. ABORTs, etc. now done
   without devices blocking.

 - scst_unregister_session_ex() removed, since there are no users of it

 -  New functions added to scst_user interface:
 
    * SCST_USER_UNREGISTER_DEVICE - to unregister device, flush mem reuse
     (SGV) cache and send UCMD_STATE_ON_CACHE_FREEING notifications for all
     freed buffers to the user space handler. Simple device close doesn't
     allow that, so all the cached buffers might look as "leaked" from the
     user space handler POV.
  
    * SCST_USER_FLUSH_CACHE - to flush mem reuse (SGV) cache and send
      UCMD_STATE_ON_CACHE_FREEING notifications for all freed buffers to
      the user space handler

    * SCST_USER_DEVICE_CAPACITY_CHANGED - to notify SCST core that the
      corresponding device has changed its capacity

 - Clustering of scst_user pages added

 - Added autogenerated SCSI SN in vdisk handler

 - Fixed race in scst_user, which could have lead to usage of already freed
   command. A misbehaving user space handler could have made ucmd to get
   dead immediately after the lock is released and that is caught
   now.

 - Support for CentOS 5.2 added (Bart Van Assche)

 - In scst_vdisk new module parameter num_threads added to specify a
   number of threads for each vdisk/vcdrom. Default is 5.

 - Access control docs updated

 - Set memory limits according to LOWMEM, not TOTALMEM

 - Major performance increase working with disk based storage

 - Now task_mgmt_fn() callback called for TARGET RESET and NEXUS LOSS
   functions only once for tgt_dev, which belongs to the session, from
   which the corresponding request came

 - SGV cache related parameters moved from scst.h to scst_sgv.h

 - Log level mgmt_minor for messages like "Warning: expected transfer
   length X for opcode Y" changed to be disabled by default

 - Added possibility to coexist if both target driver and dev handler
   need custom memory allocation. Direct consequences: (1) scst_local
   can work with scst_user's devices and (2) scst_user now compatible
   with iscsi-scst if put_page_callback patch not applied.

 - Depecated scst_cmd_get_tgt_resp_flags() removed

 - SWP and TAS parameters made changable in vdisk handler

 - External interface changed to fix usage of in_atomic(). Now target
   drivers and dev handlers need to explicitly supply preferred execution
   context in scst_cmd_done() and scst_tgt_cmd_done()

 - Handling of internal REQUEST SENSE fixed.

 - Fixed SAM violation (HiSup bit must be set in INQUIRY response)

 - Fixed handling of VERIFY commands that comes with BYTCHK unset

 - Handling of double reset UAs made more reliable

 - Threads made per-device

 - User space device handler added

 - New SGV cache low memory management backend with memory flow control
   facility was implemented, thanks to Krzysztof Blaszkowski.

 - FILEIO was renamed to VDISK. BLOCKIO added to it, thanks to Ross S. W.
   Walker and Vu Pham.

 - Updated to work on 2.6.20.x, no update for 2.6.21.x isn't needed

 - Internal locking and execution context were reimplemnted. As some of
   the results now FILEIO has >1 IO threads and implemented full support
   for SCSI task attributes (SIMPLE, ORDERED, etc.).

 - Ability to have per-target default security groups added.

 - Updated to work on 2.6.19.x, thanks to Ming Zhang.

 - Internal threads management reimplemented based on kthread*() API,
   thanks to Ming Zhang.

 - /proc implementation moved to seq_*() library, thanks to Ming Zhang.
   Target drivers need to be updated accordingly.

   and scst_mgmt_translate_lun() was changed to a hash-based one.

 - Building from the Linux kernel tree updated, inside kernel building fixed.

 - Support for CPU cache flushing before doing DMA to target devices added.

 - A lot of cleanups, bug fixes and improvements.

Summary of changes between versions 0.9.4 and 0.9.5
---------------------------------------------------

 - Fixed many found task management related problems, especially in the
   RESETs area. CONFIG_SCST_DEBUG_TM compilation option added (see README).

 - Updated to work on kernels version 2.6.18+.

 - FILEIO_ONLY added. If it's defined, there is no need to patch the
   kernel, but pass-through modules (scst_disk, scst_tape, etc.) are not
   supported).

 - Fixed problems with big amount of LUNs (500+).

 - Timer-based retries for targets after SCST_TGT_RES_QUEUE_FULL status
   implemented.

 - More intelligent IO flow control implemented.

 - Fixed broken CDROM FILEIO. Before that it always reported 
   "No medium found"

 - Data synchronization fixes and improvements in FILEIO. Added FUA
   support.

 - Fixed READ(6)/WRITE(6) CDB decoding for block devices.
   This bug prevented FreeBSD initiators from working.

 - Implemented sgv_pool. It is mempool-like interface, which caches
   built SG-vectors in order not to rebuild them again for every
   subsequent command, so saves performance price of building
   SG-vectors, including pages allocation, and of additional context
   switches.

 - For ABORTED commands xmit_response() now called. A target driver
   should recognized such commands using new function
   scst_cmd_aborted(). Also there are some other cleanups, improvements
   and interfaces changes that affect target drivers and dev handlers.
   You can find their full list by diff'ing scsi_tgt.h between versions
   0.9.4 and 0.9.5.

 - Function alloc_data_buf() added to struct scst_tgt_template as well
   as data_buf_tgt_alloc added to struct scst_cmd to allow a target
   driver implement own memory management handler (by Arne Redlich).

 - Exported symbols are now not GPL'ed

 - Various cleanups and a lot of bug fixes.

   increased

 - Cleanups and bug fixes, including several race-based crashes

Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3-pre1 and 0.9.3-pre2

 - Task management was considerably redone. Particularly, now the result
   of ABORT TASK is returned to remote initiator immediately, except if
   the result of the aborted command is already started to be sent.

 - Per-session commands serialization implemented as part of "device
   blocking" cleanup.

 - UA generating after MODE SELECT and LOG SELECT implemented

 - Cleanups and bug fixes

Summary of changes between versions 0.9.2 and 0.9.3-pre1
--------------------------------------------------------

 - Sophisticated per-initiator access and devices visibility management added
   (different initiators now could see different set of devices with
   different permissions)

 - FILEIO dev handler was reimplemented in most areas, including:

    * Management interface via /proc added

    * Various defects using devices/files larger 2Gb were fixed. Thanks
      to Mark Buechler.

    * New CDROM FILEIO handler added.

    * Now per-session threads created to improve concurrent performance.
 
    * New flags added that allow using virtual devices as read only,
      with write through caching or in O_DIRECT mode.

    * Task management support added.

 - RAID controller (type 0xC) dev handler added.

 - SCSI processor (type 3) dev handler added.

 - Device handlers' source code layout changed, all device handlers
   live in one subdirectory now.
 
 - Crash on memory allocation failure while building SG data vector
   fixed.

 - Other minor fixes

Summary of changes between versions 0.9.0a and 0.9.1
----------------------------------------------------

 - scst_debug.* files are also installed together with scsi_tgt.h
   (required by QLA2x00 target and could be useful for other target
   drivers)
 
 - CDB length for unknown commands (e.g. vendor ones) is now determined
   from CDB
   
 - Race with the commands serialization on one drive fixed
   
 - Cleanup
